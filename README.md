## What's the purpose of this `README.md` file?

I'm creating this React portfolio repository for a few reasons. Firstly, it's a way for me to find employment as a front-end React developer. By showcasing my skills and projects, potential employers can see what I'm capable of. Secondly, I want to demonstrate that I can plan and document my work effectively. It shows that I'm organized and take my projects seriously. Lastly, I hope to give others insight into how I think and organize my projects. By sharing my coding process and project structure, I want to provide a glimpse into how I work. This portfolio is my way of presenting myself professionally and showing what I can do in the field of front-end development.

## Planning

**PAGES TABLE**
